# Search Result Clustering

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to partition data points based on similarity. 

Implemented a cluster based visualization of 10 (or more) relevant retrieved results for a given search query. That is, no standard list based result visualization is used here but a visualization that supports exploration by illustrating the relation (e.g. similarity) between the results.

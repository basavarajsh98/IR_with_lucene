Nawabshah (Sindhi: نوابشاھ, Urdu: نوابشاہ) is a tehsil and headquarters of the Shaheed Benazirabad District of Sindh province, Pakistan. This city is situated in the middle of Sindh province. It is the 27th largest city in Pakistan. Nawabshah Tehsil (formerly known as Nasrat Tehsil from 1907 to 1909) was established in 1907 by the British government. The tehsil was a part of Hyderabad district (1907 - 1912). On 1 November 1912 Nawabshah was upgraded to a district status of Sind Division.
In 1909, Syed Nawab Ali Shah donated 200 acres of land to British government for construction of a town railway station and 60 acres of land for construction of buildings of district and taluka offices free of cost. To commemorate this, the British government then changed the name of Nasrat town to Nawabshah town
